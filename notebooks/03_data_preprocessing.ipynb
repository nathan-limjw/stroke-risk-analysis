Additionally, these features have high multicollinearity with other strong predictors, which would interfere with model performance.\n",

Despite the high p-value in the Chi-Square analysis of `smoking_status` and `stroke` (0.511786), and the lack of difference in distribution and median values in the boxplot, literature reviews suggest otherwise that BMI and smoking history are in fact strong predictors of stroke. As such, their values are kept for the modelling process."
